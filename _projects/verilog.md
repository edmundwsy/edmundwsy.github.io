title: Verilog waveform measuring
description:
  A simple waveform measurement instrument was designed using the EGO-1 Pocket Lab card and pragrammed by Verilog HDL. This instrument can sample and convert the waveform via AD7476 module, then calculate the peak-to-peak value and frequency of the waveform, and then display the measurement data on the digital tube or send the data to the host via UART serial port in ASCII code. <br>
  This is the project of a <b>3rd-year undergraduate course </b> at XJTU.
