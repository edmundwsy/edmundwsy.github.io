## Documentation

### Navigation

Navigation consists of driving the robot via the found path by the path
planner to the goal. Most navigation is already integrated with the
provided ROS packages for the TIAGo. In this project, a node is added
called \"navigation_point_direction\" that will point the head towards
the predicted direction the robot will drive. This way, humans around
the robot will better understand where the robot will drive, thus making
it safer. The second advantage is that the head will look to the new
driving direction a bit in advance. This way, the sensors can detect
obstacles earlier, and thereby the TIAGo can plan more efficiently.

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/navigation_point_direction_simulation.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="320" zoomable=true %}

In the existing packages, a node publishes a vector of the predicted
driving direction, and the Point Direction node reads this vector. The
value is calculated to the head's pitch and yaw rotation values. When
the robot makes a sharp turn left or right, without moving forward, the
head will look down and in that direction, as can be seen in figure
[2]. The more the robot will drive forward and not turn, the more the head will look straight ahead.
The head rotation is limited to +-70 degrees left and right, and +-50
degrees up and down. The calculation is robust to changing the sign of
the angle, so if the vector points left, the head will always look to
the left and visa versa. If the vector crosses 180 degrees, to the
back, then the head will fast rotate from one side 70 degrees to the
other side 70 degrees. In the current ROS program that will never happen
as the robot never drives backwards, only rotation and forward. The head
orientation is published to the head_controller topic, ensuring the
head will move in the correct directions. The head controller action
server is not used as this control is not crucial or time-dependent for
other TIAGo functionalities.Â In the simulation, moving the head works
fine when the robot drives and rotates. When the prediction vector is
also plotted in RViz (as a green arrow), it is visible that the head
rotations copy the behavior of the vector.

### Path Planning

Path planning is to generate a collision-free trajectory from TIAGo's
current position to the goal. To avoid a collision, the robot should be
able to estimate obstacles' shape and position and build an occupancy
map for the planner. In the package, a static occupancy map is created
from laser data sampled by onboard laser and RGB-D camera. It can
provide an accurate perception of static obstacles; however, it fails to
work on dynamic obstacles. In our case, visitors are walking around
TIAGo, so dynamic obstacle avoidance is essential. We implemented a
simple obstacle extractor and tracker to estimate the position and
velocity of these obstacles. First, laser inputs are converted to point
cloud. Then, clustering is applied to these points to extract line
segments and circles. Since point segments are only caused by walls or
furniture, we discard them and only keep the circles. The radius of
circles are obtained in this step. Then, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
is applied to these clusters to track their movement and estimate their
accurate position and velocity. These observations are published to
`/obstacle_observer/obstacles` topic whose message type is defined in the
obstacle_observer package.

We use the default A\* for global planning and an open-source package
`teb_local_planner` for local planning. The goal of a global planner is
to find a discrete path with colliding wall and table. For the local
planner, it should refine the path considering the nonholonomic
constraints of the robot base and avoid dynamic obstacles. The
`teb_local_planner` package enables these
functions [^1], but the input message type has to be `ObstacleArrayMsg`
from costmap_converter package. We implemented a dynamic_obs_node as
a bridge between two packages. It subscribes to
`/obstacle_observer/obstacles` and publish to
`/move_base/TebLocalPlannerROS/obstacles`.

Although the idea seemed good, after implementation we found that the
algorithm was not robust. In simulated tests, the laser detection either
missed the visitor or treated the chair as a visitor, regardless of the
parameters we set. This success rate was too low (< 30%) to be used
in the final system. In the end we decided to use `move_base` package
and only consider static obstacles.

### Picking Sequence

The main purpose of the picking sequence is to execute several robot
actions as a whole, e.g. search cups, pick cups, move to the recycling
bin, and place cups inside the bin. All robot behaviors related to the
cup are encapsulated in this ROS node. These behaviors are implemented
by ROS action servers. This /sequence_node will run the ROS action
client corresponding to the standalone functions. It is launched when
the user presses the \"searching cups\" button on GUI. Once started, it
will first run a search client to find the nearest coffee cups by
AprilTag markers on the cup. Next, the robot will run a move client to
approach the detected coffee cup and prepare to pick. Then, a pick
client is called to prepare the picking action and finally pick the
detected coffee cup. If the cup is successfully picked, another move
client is called to drive the robot to the recycling bin. Finally, the
robot will run a place client to place the cup inside the bin. Once the
program was interrupted with some errors, e.g. TIAGo failed to pick the
cup, or no cups were found, the `/sequence_node` will terminate with some
error code.

arrow."%}

#### Search server

Search Server is a ROS action server we build from scratch for searching coffee cups.
It uses a self-defined message type named as `Search.action` for
communication between server and client. Similar to other action
messages, it consists of a goal, a result, and feedback. The goal is an
integer that indicates the number of objects to search for. The result
contains a boolean variable representing success or failure and an
integer variable representing the ID of the detected AprilTag marker.
This ROS action server subscribes to `/tag_detection` provided by the
existing AprilTag_ros package. It maintains a ROS service waiting to be
called by the ROS action client. Once called, the server will execute
commands in 3 stages. First, TIAGo will scan the entire area by turning
its head and looking around. Simultaneously, TIAGo will receive and
analyze detection results from `/tag_detection` and save the position and
orientation of one selected AprilTag marker. Then, the robot will apply
a homogeneous transformation to compute a collision-free waypoint in
front of the marker in the map frame. This waypoint is set to be 0.78
meters ahead of the coffee cup to be picked. Finally, TIAGo will send
this waypoint to move_base and will move to it.

#### Pick server

is a ROS action server for path planning in cup picking. It utilizes
moveit[^2], an open-source project for robot arm planning. Similar to
Search Server, it subscribes to `/tag_detections` topic as well. It also
subscribes to several ROS service, e.g. `add_collision_object` and
`remove_collision_object` to build and clean the occupancy map. This map
helps to find a collision-free trajectory for the TIAGo gripper to grasp
the cup. Another ROS server it subscribes to is `get_grasp_pose`, which
provides the accurate grasp position when the robot is working on a
coffee cup.

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/poses.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="320" zoomable=true alt="Settings of three grasp poses: pre-grasp pose (red), grasp pose (yellow) and post-grasp pose (green). The post pose is 10 centimeters above the pre pose."%}

The pick server should receive requests from the pick client in the
sequence_node. The request should contain the exact ID of the coffee
cup detected by the search server The entire picking process can be
separated into eight states.

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/pre_grasp_pose.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="480" zoomable=true alt="Pre-grasp pose in the simulation"%}

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/grasp_pose.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="480" zoomable=true alt="Grasp pose in the simulation"%}

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/post_grasp_pose.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="480" zoomable=true alt="Post-grasp pose in the simulation"%}

1.  **Look around**. TIAGo's head iterate from 7 preset poses, covering all
    areas it can see to find and locate the request AprilTag marker.

2.  **Add collision objects**. TIAGo utilizes its RGB-D camera to build an
    occupancy map including cups and the table.

3.  **Compute grasp position**. Based on the position and orientation of the
    AprilTag marker in the camera frame, TIAGo computes the gripper's
    grasp poses and transforms it into the base frame. The grasp pose is
    the pose of the gripper to pick the object. Pre-grasp pose and
    post-grasp pose should be easy to reach safely.

4.  **Move to pre-grasp pose**. TIAGo first raises its right arm, then
    slowly moves the gripper to the pre-grasp position.

5.  **Move to grasp pose**. TIAGo puts its gripper out to the cup.

6.  **Close the gripper and attach the cup**.

7.  **Move to post-grasp pose**.

8.  **Remove collision objects**. The occupancy map is cleaned, and robots
    can move to other positions

#### Place Server

This part contains the ROS action server for placing the coffee cup in the
recycling bin. Due to the location of the bin being fixed, we do not
need any AprilTag marker to tell TIAGo where the gripper should move. We
use a fixed gripper pose hard-coded in `/sequence_node`, sent to the
place server as a goal. The gripper pose is 0.60 meters in front of the
robot, 0.10 meters to the right, and 0.4 meters high in the base_link
frame. After tuning in the simulation, we found that this is the best
parameter setting for placing cups into the bin. Similar to picking, the
place server can be divided into three steps. First, TIAGo looks around
and builds an occupancy map of the environment. Second, TIAGo moves its
arm to the placing pose and opens the gripper to release the coffee cup.
Finally, TIAGo tucks its arms and clears the occupancy map.

#### Performance

We test the performance of search-pick-place sequence in the simulation
environment. We modified the position and orientation of the coffee cup
and started the robot in different positions to test the performance of
our robot in different environments.

As shown in the table, our node reaches 60% success rate in search, pick and place task. As for search server, the success rate is
100%. This is because it utilizes the AprilTag marker, which guarantees
its stability and accuracy. For pick server, the success rate is 60%,
which is the lowest among three implemented servers. For place server,
the success rate is 100%. Due to we use a fixed position of the coffee
bins and there are no obstacles between the table and the bin, placing
task is relatively easy. It's obvious that if pick server succeeds, the
place server will succeed.

Experiments in simulation environment

As indicated in the table, pick server is the bottleneck of this node.
The failure reason of pick server is complex. For test 01, 02, 06,
picking failed because the orientation is not suitable. In our node, we
only managed to use the right gripper to pick objects, and we use the
orientation of AprilTag markers to compute the pre-grasp and grasp pose.
Therefore, when the AprilTag marker is orienting to the left of the
robot , the robot may not find a feasible
trajectory to move the cup, and thus, picking will fail.

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/bad_pick_02.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="360" zoomable=true alt="Failed picking: orientation not suitable"%}

{% include figure.html path="/assets/img/47007-mdp/bad_pick_03.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="360" zoomable=true alt="Failed picking: too far to reach"%}

For test 08, the distance between the robot and the coffee cup is too
large. Therefore, robot's gripper cannot reach
the cup when it fully strengthens its arm. Although it has already reached
the pre-grasp pose, however, it has some problem to reach the grasp pose
so that picking failed.
