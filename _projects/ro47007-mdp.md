title: Task planning with PDDL inference for the TIAGo robot
description:
  1. The motion planning part is based on MoveIt and teb_local_planner <br>
  2. The object perception is achieved by detecting Apriltag markers on the objects <br>
  3. The planning domain definition language is applied for high-level reasoning and task planning <br>
  4. The demonstration in Gazebo simulation is finished as the course project of <b>Knowledge Representation and Symbolic Reasoning</b> at TU Delft. <br>
  5. The real-world demonstration is achieved as parts of the <b>Mulitdisciplinary Project</b>
