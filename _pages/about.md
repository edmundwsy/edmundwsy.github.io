I am a 2nd-year master student in robotics at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/rb/msc-robotics/). I obtained my B.Eng. at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), China. I finished my bachelor's thesis at [FAST Lab](http://www.zju-fast.com/), Zhejiang University. In 2020 I was a visiting student in University of Edinburgh.

As a new learner to robotics, I am interested in **drones**, **planning**, **optimal control** and **optimization**.

<!-- ðŸ”­ Now I am working on **multi-robots motion planning in dynamic environment** at Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab, TU Delft, supervised by Dr. Gang Chen and Dr. Javier Alonso-Mora. Previously I worked in **motion planning** and **event-based vision** as my bachelor thesis, supervised by Dr. Fei Gao, at [FAST Lab](http://www.zju-fast.com/), Zhejiang University. _We are sincerely doing really cool things to push the boundary of autonomous drones!_ -->

<!-- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for PhD positions in roboticsï¼ˆespecially in planning). -->

I'm always up for academic discussions and collaborations! Feel free to contact me with any questions and let's make progress together!
