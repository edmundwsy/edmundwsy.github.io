<!-- I am soon to start my PhD at the Learning Systems and Robotics (LSY) Lab at TUM, subject to the approval of my German visa application. -->
<!-- I graduated with Cum Laude from the MSc Robotics program at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/rb/msc-robotics/), where I was supervised by Dr. Javier Alonso-Mora and Dr. Gang Chen. -->

I am pursuing my master's degree at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/rb/msc-robotics/), where I was supervised by Dr. Javier Alonso-Mora and Dr. Gang Chen.
I obtained my B.Eng. in Automation at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University), China.
I finished my bachelor's thesis at [FAST Lab](http://www.zju-fast.com/), Zhejiang University, where I worked on event-based vision and motion planning.
In 2020 I was a visiting student in University of Edinburgh.

<!-- I am trilled to have been accepted to ETH Robotics Summer School this year. -->

As a new learner to robotics, I am interested in **planning**, **control** and **optimization**.

<!-- ðŸ”­ Now I am working on **multi-robots motion planning in dynamic environment** at Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab, TU Delft, supervised by Dr. Gang Chen and Dr. Javier Alonso-Mora. Previously I worked in **motion planning** and **event-based vision** as my bachelor thesis, supervised by Dr. Fei Gao, at [FAST Lab](http://www.zju-fast.com/), Zhejiang University. _We are sincerely doing really cool things to push the boundary of autonomous drones!_ -->

<!-- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for PhD positions in roboticsï¼ˆespecially in planning). -->

For me, the most intoxicating aspect of robotics is the wonderful harmony between crude engineering tasks like screwing and the elegant simplicity of mathematics, and the sheer joy of witnessing the birth of new robots, each one a testament to human ingenuity and technological progress.

I'm always up for academic discussions and collaborations! Feel free to contact me with any questions and let's create a better world together!
