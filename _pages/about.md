✨ Let's explore something interesting together ~

🔭 Currently I am pursuing my master's degree 🏫️  at [Technische Universiteit Delft (MSc Robotics)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/rb/msc-robotics/). Previously I got my Bachelor's degree (Honor's Engineering Program, Qian Xuesen's Class) at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), China. 

🌱 I’m currently working in **motion planning**, **event-based vision**, supervised by Dr. Fei Gao, at [ZJU-FAST](http://www.zju-fast.com/) lab, Zhejiang University. *We are sincerely doing really cool things to push the boundary of quadrotors here!*

🤔 I’m looking for PhD positions in robotics. If you are interested in my background and have some available positions, please let me know!!! 😄️

🖋️ I'm open to any discussions. If you have any question about robotics, please feel free to contact me. 📫 [siyuanwu99@gmail.com](mailto:siyuanwu99@gmail.com)
