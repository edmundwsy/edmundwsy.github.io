✨ Let's explore something interesting together~

🖋️ Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in robotics at [Technische Universiteit Delft (MSc Robotics)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/rb/msc-robotics/) from September, 2021. I obtained my bachelor's degree in automation (Qian Xuesen's class, with honor) in 2021 from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), China. I finished my bachelor's thesis at [FAST Lab](http://www.zju-fast.com/), Zhejiang University. In 2020 I was a visiting student in University of Edinburgh.

🌱 As a new learner to robotics, I am interested in **drones**, **planning**, **optimal control** and **optimization**.

🔭 Now I am working on **multi-robots motion planning in dynamic environment** at Autonomous Multi-Robots Lab, TU Delft, supervised by Dr. Gang Chen and Dr. Javier Alonso-Mora. Previously I worked in **motion planning** and **event-based vision** as my bachelor thesis, supervised by Dr. Fei Gao, at [FAST Lab](http://www.zju-fast.com/), Zhejiang University. _We are sincerely doing really cool things to push the boundary of autonomous drones!_

🤔 I’m looking for PhD positions in robotics（especially in planning).

📫 I'm always up for academic discussions and collaborations! Feel free to contact me with any questions about my research or projects. Let's connect and make progress together! 😄
