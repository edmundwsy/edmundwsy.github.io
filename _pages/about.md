✨ Let's explore something interesting together~

🖋️ I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Automation (Qian Xuesen's class, with honor) in 2021 from 🏫️[Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), China. In 2020 I was a visiting student in 🏫️University of Edinburgh.
I started my MSc Robotics study at 🏫️[Technische Universiteit Delft (MSc Robotics)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/rb/msc-robotics/) in September, 2021.

🌱 As a new learner to robotics, I am interested in **MAVs**, **motion planning**, **MPC** and **reinforcement learning**.

🔭 Previously I worked in **motion planning**, **event-based vision** as my bachelor thesis, supervised by Dr. Fei Gao, at [ZJU-FAST](http://www.zju-fast.com/) lab, 🏫️Zhejiang University. *We are sincerely doing really cool things to push the boundary of quadrotors here!*

🤔 I’m looking for PhD positions in robotics（especially in robot planning). If you are interested in my background and have some available positions, please let me know!!! 😄️
